# Alex Egerev's Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This study guide was created for the UPenn Bootcamp. 

The challenge was to create an accessible web page. 

By putting in "alts" for the images in the index.html sheet, and commenting what I was doing in the style.css sheet, I am able to tell everyone what I did.

## Usage

The webpage displays a picture and a banner with the logo and the weblinks to different sections. By clicking on those links, the user can "jump" to different sections of the web page.

ABOUT THE LOGO: With the updated logo colors (before, it was all white and gray; now, it's yellow and blue), this website - and this repository - and I - support Ukraine every step of the way. 

We wish this war never happened, but whatever it takes, we will support Ukraine to the end.
